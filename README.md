I am impressed by your tenacity to actually read the README.

Not many people actually do this y'know.

Though it can be pretty important.

Like how this was written in Xcode version 5.1.1, and it may have compatability issues with other versions.

Aren't you glad you know this now?

Isn't your life full of fulfillment?

Yeah, I know.

It's okay.

I'm here for you.
